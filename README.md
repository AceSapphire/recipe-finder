🍽️ Recipe Finder
A simple and responsive web app that helps you find recipes based on ingredients or dish names built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

📌 About the Project
The Recipe Finder lets you search for recipes by typing in any ingredient or dish name. It connects to a public API to fetch recipes and shows you a list of results with images. You can then click a recipe to see more details like ingredients and instructions.
I’m keeping the design simple, clean, and user-friendly, while making sure it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

✨ Features (Completed & Planned)
✅ Search recipes by ingredient or dish name
 ✅ Display recipe name and image in results
 ✅ Responsive layout for different screen sizes
